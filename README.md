# GetDataProgramAssignment
This repository contains the programming assignment files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course. The assignment is to create a tidy data set given various source files. The assignment requires (1) merging the training and testing sets to create one data set, (2) extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, (3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, (4) Label the data set with descriptive activity names, and (5) create a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# File Description
Codebook.md is a file containing descriptions of the variable names as well as transformations that took place

run_analysis.R contains the actual programming code to complete the programming assignment

tidy_data.txt is the final result of the cleaned up data from the original source files
# Using the Script
The run_analysis.R file is used for illustrative purposes of submitting the programming code. If the code is to be used, please ensure you set the working directory
